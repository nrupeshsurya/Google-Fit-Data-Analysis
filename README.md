# Google-Fit-Analysis
Analyzing my Google Fit data using pandas and matplotlib

This tutorial will show you how you can analyse your Google Fit data to obtain time series data.

There are many columns in the csv file and you can manually manipulate whichever ones you choose to obtain the time series data.
Also the time series currently selected is 2020-01-01 to 2020-03-31. You can modify these values also accordingly.


While performing the experiment, make sure you replace your data with your own. I have attached my own data for reference.
You can obtain your Google Fit data from takeout.google.com
